# Demo-Thirtytwo

### ABOUT:

* Holy Crap, got it working! I just spent the past 4 days trying to figure out "Using Babel CLI for Server compile" with a server-side build. Tricky, but once you get the gist of the whole process (and see it actually work with you're own project) it makes alot more sense. Was not familiar with that bundling/build/rendering approach before.

* I made (some) progress when I wrote the above but was wooooooefully un-prepared for again, basically breaking everthing down and re-building step-by-step. The TS (.ts) all needed fixing (I knew that months ago and still all TS needs work). Server/renderer needs immediate work and everything needs linting, type checking and more. Need to triple check LC and SC (tough to know "what is correct" behavior with all this). 

* Using Babel CLI for Server compile.
